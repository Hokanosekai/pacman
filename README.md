## Description

This project have been made for me to learn `C` and `SDL2` library.

## Usage

To compile the project, you need to have `SDL2` and `SDL2_image` installed on your computer.

Then, you can compile the project with the following command:

```bash
cd src
make
```

This will create a `pacman` executable in the `bin` folder.

To run the game, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd bin
chmod +x pacman
./pacman
```

To clean the project, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd src
make clean
```

This will remove all the `.o` files and the `pacman` executable.

## Features

* Custom level file format (see <a href="#leveling">Leveling</a>)
* Custom tileset file format (see [tileset.png](assets/textures/tileset.png))
* Custom font file format (see [font.ttf](assets/font.ttf)) (note that the default font is Open Sans Regular from Google Fonts)
* Sprite animation (ghosts and pacman) :
  * Ghosts (see <a href="#ghosts">Ghosts</a>)
  * Pacman (see <a href="#pacman">Pacman</a>)
* Ghost AI (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde)
* Bonus (cherry, strawberry, orange, apple) (see <a href="#bonus">Bonus</a>)

## Leveling

You can create your own level by editing `level.txt` file in the `data` folder.

All the tiles are defined in the [tileset.png](assets/textures/tileset.png) file.

Here is the list of all the tiles:

> Note that the tileset is composed of 32x32 tiles.

> Note also that you have multiple walls types (see [tileset.png](assets/textures/tileset.png)). You have a wall type that is taken the 2/3 of the tile and another one that is taken the 1/3 of the tile, the last one is centered in the tile.

## Ghosts

The ghosts are controlled by a random algorithm. The ghosts can move in 4 directions (up, down, left and right). The ghosts can't move in the opposite direction of their current direction.

| Ghost | Color | Sprite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blinky | Red | ![Ghost](assets/sprites/ghost_3.png) |
| Pinky | Pink | ![Ghost](assets/sprites/ghost_2.png) |
| Inky | Cyan | ![Ghost](assets/sprites/ghost_1.png) |
| Clyde | Orange | ![Ghost](assets/sprites/ghost_4.png) |
| Scared ghost | White / Blue | ![Ghost](assets/sprites/ghost_scared.png) |

## Bonus

The bonus will appear at a random interval of time and have a random position on the map. The bonus will disappear after a certain amount of time. Then the bonus will automatically reappear at a random interval of time and have a random position on the map.
